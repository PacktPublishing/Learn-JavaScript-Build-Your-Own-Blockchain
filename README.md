## About the Video Course
As the Blockchain revolution rages around us, you may be feeling left behind as the technology and coin values continue to develop at breakneck speed.
As budding JavaScript developers, breaking into Blockchain tech is something we’ve most likely wanted as we definitely need to stay up-to-speed in our evolving environment.

While the steep and rigorous learning curve that the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum programming present may be too much for us as we step into the Blockchain arena, this course eases the barrier of entry with a hands-on implementation of Blockchain tech with a familiar language, JavaScript, that you can use to create and understand a Blockchain system capable of hosting our own Cryptocurrency.

Join me in Learn java script: Build your own Blockchain and we’ll position ourselves to become well rounded JavaScript developers and new Blockchain entrepreneurs.
